How to Update from Fusion-C 1.0, or 1.1  to Fusion-C 1.2

All versions are using the same folder structure.

If you made changes inside the Fusion-C files, or Fusion-C folder save them
in another place.

Now just copy 
 	"Working Folder/fusion-c/""	over your existing "fusion-c" folder (Must be inside Working Folder, if you did not change default structure)
	"Working Folder/Tools"		over your existing "Tool" folder
	"Working Folder/Makefile"	over your existing Makefile file
	"Working Folder/compil.bat"	over your existing compil.bat file

thatâ€™s all.
